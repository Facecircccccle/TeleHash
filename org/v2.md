telehash v2 (draft)
===================

## Intro

The first version was a minimal layer to do just the DHT/NAT and tried to be very generic and extensible, deferring identity and transport to the app.  This second version drastically simplifies the base protocol and incorporates the identity and transport elements into the core.

## Vocab

* DHT - Distributed Hash Table
* NAT - A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs (Network Address Translation)
* Hashname - The SHA1(public key + space) of a RSA keypair that is part of a space, the unique ID of an individual application/instance using telehash
* Packet - A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any hashnames
* Switch - The name of the software layer or service parsing packets for one or more hashnames
* Space - A regular hostname representing a collection of hashnames that have some trust or shared resources
* Operator - A special hashname that acts as a coordinator to introduce/describe a space to any other hashname
* Line - When any two hashnames connect and exchange their identity to form a temporary session

## Parsing

Every packet must begin with two bytes that are a short unsigned integer representing the length of bytes that follow it.  That length of bytes are UTF8 encoded JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser.  Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and referenced as the 'BODY' when used.

    [LENGTH][JSON][BODY]

## JSON

The JSON included in any packet is where the keys are to tell a switch how to process it based on the behaviors defined below.  It is intended to be open for growing and evolving outside of the keys defined here, but any app-specific usage should be careful to name things so as to not conflict with future additions.

These are the keys that a switch will look for in the JSON during processing:

* `sig` - the signature of the BODY
* `who` - request to get the key for a hashname, `key` is the response
* `open` - request to establish a line, create a session between two hashnames, `line` and `sline` is the response
* `seek` - looking for hashnames closer to this value, `see` is the response
* `pop` and `stream` - only valid within a line
* `sock` and `req` - only valid within a stream

### Spaces

A space is simply a collection of RSA public keys that have some trust each other (typically a single application domain) and is identified simply by a valid hostname.  Every public key within a space is identified by it's hashname, which is the SHA1 of it's public key + space name (simple string append of SHA1(pubkey+space)).

Every space is administrated by "operators" who will resolve a hashname to it's public key for anyone, and this list of operators is typically bundled within an app (seed list).  Operators may perform other app administrative duties such as updating the seed list, redirecting to other spaces and operators, providing what level of supported protocols different hashnames have, etc.

Spaces may also be defined where anyone can be an operator, a typical open DHT, but trust must then be externally determined by the application within such spaces.

### `sig` - Signed Packets

Any packet sent between two hashnames can be signed, this is very important for the initial packets so that they can include some assertion of their validity.

To sign any packet, take it's binary serialized output (as if it was going to be written to the network) and perform an RSA HMAC-MD5 signature on it.  Use that original packet as the BODY for a new packet, and include the base64 of the signature as the value to the `sig` in the JSON.

The recipient may or may not know the public key for the sending hashname yet to validate the incoming signature and it may have to ask an operator for the key first before it can process the BODY as a new (verified) packet.

### Ad-Hoc Packets

Any packet that doesn't have a `sig` or `line` is considered an ad-hoc packet and must include the following fields as a form of identity:

* `to` - the hashname of the recipient
* `from` - the sending hashname

If the packet is going to be signed, it must also include an expiration time of the request as the integer value to `x` in epoch milliseconds to discourage replay attacks.  A suggested default is 10 seconds in the future (or more if required by network latency).

Additionally, if the sender is from a different space than the recipient it must include that as the `space` value.

### `who` - Key Lookups

A `who` is a request to return the public key for the hashname included in it's value and must always be signed or within a line.

Every hashname must be able to respond to a `who` request for at least itself and optionally for any others it knows, but operators are expected to return them for any valid hashname in their space.

After (optionally) verifying the request, the recipient returns the public key by sending back to the requesting hashname a packet with a `key` and the value being the same as the original `who` requested.  The BODY then contains the actual public key value, and if it's too large for one packet it can be broken into multiple, each of which contains a `seq` key with an integer value starting at 0 and incrementing.  These responses may also optionally be signed so that the recipient can validate that it came from the operator it requested it from (depending on the apps security requirements).

### `open` - Establishing a Line

The `open` key is used to establish an active session between any two hashnames and their current IPPs, this is called a line.  The value is set to a random SHA1 value kept secret and sent only to the recipient hashname.  The packet must be signed by the sender and verified before being processed.

Upon receiving, any hashname can check the incoming `from` and see if it already knows the public key for it, if it does it can verify the signature and return a corresponding packet containing it's own secret `open` to confirm the line.  Once either side has both sent an open and received one, it calculates a secret `line` value by calculating the SHA1 of the two open values concatenated in sorted order, SHA1([sender.open, recipient.open].sort().join("")).

Once a line is calculated all subsequent packets should include only the same `line` value in each direction as the secret for the receiving switch to identify it.  Only the `open` value is used to initiate a new line at any time.

Once a line is established, any packet may be optionally encrypted since both sides have each other's public key.  An encrypted packet simply uses `sline` as the key instead of `line` and the BODY is a fully encrypted original packet.  The receiver then decrypts the BODY and processes it as a normal packet (LENGTH/JSON/BODY) from the sending hashname as if it had the `line` value in it.

### `seek` - Finding Hashnames (DHT)

Any space can support a DHT if enough of it's hashnames are connected to each other and respond to `seek` requests properly.  The bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance (to be defined again here based on v1).

The `seek` value is always a 40 character hex (a SHA1 of anything), it can be used to find other hashnames directly or by an app to find one or more hashnames for any arbitrary content.  Each space and app may use this differently, but the basic rules around discovery are the same.

When one hashname wants to lookup a hash, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `see` array of addresses that are closer to the hash value than they are, if any (no response if none).  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d,123.45.67.89,10111" and the IP can be v4 or v6 (there can be multiple entries in the array for one hashname).

Any `seek` that is not part of a line may be signed if it's known the recipient has their public key to verify (like to an operator), but most of these requests in a normal DHT lookup will be to hashnames that will likely never need to be interacted with again so a lightweight verification called `via` is used to assert a minimum level of trust.  These non-line and non-signed seek requests must include a `via` with the value being the hashname that the recipient was discovered from (in a `see` response);  All hashnames must then open one or more lines in order to begin doing `seek` requests starting from them.  Any incoming `via` must be validated by the recipient such that they have an open line to the hashname in the value so that they know who referred them.

### `pop` - Working around NATs 

When any hashname is told about a new one (in the `see`), there may be a NAT between them so they must both be told to send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." The `pop` value is used to do this and contains the target hashname being contacted for the first time.  Any `pop` works just like a `seek` and must be in a line, signed, or contain a `via` for validation.

The recipient of the `pop` must then send a `poping` with the value being the address (hash,ip,port) of the `pop` sender, and send this to the hashname identified in the value of the `pop` that is has a line open to.

The `popping` recipient then sends an ad-hock packed with a `popped` of true to the address given in the `popping` value if it hasn't seen any packets from that hashname yet (it's own NAT may have dropped them).  This should then create the proper routes between any two NATs for the two to talk.

When the original hashname receives a `popped` it should resend the original packet it was trying to send to the target hashname since the path should be open now and the original was likely dropped.

### `stream` - Ordering and Retransmission

A line establishes a lossy connection between hashnames, streamer adds a lightweight stream representation to order, buffer, and retransmit packets.

Any hashname can open a stream simply by sending a `stream` key with a unique 40 length hex value (SHA1) that is the same on all subsequent packets for that stream and returned in all responses by the receiver. All streams have a `seq` integer value that starts at 0 and increments per packet sent.

A buffer of sent packets must be kept keyed by the `seq` value until the receiving hashname has responded confirming them in a `ack` and not in the `miss`. The `ack` is the highest known `seq` value received. The `miss` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `ack` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the missing sequence values up to the `ack`.  Upon receipt those missed packets should be resent verbatim.

By default a session should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default (senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When there's consistently missing packets, senders should limit the number of packets beyond the confirmed range. (TBD)

The JSON and/or BODY can be used arbitrarily within a stream by an app, multiple streams may exist between two hashnames and their state should be preserved as long as the line is open.

### `sock` - Socket Proxy

A stream can be requested to become a simple raw TCP socket proxy by sending a `sock` key with a value of any "IP:PORT", the receiving hashname should carefully decide if it wants to support this and the destination IP to prevent accidental abuse.  If the destination IP:PORT is successfully opened, the identical `sock` value is returned, if there is any error it is returned in the string value instead.

At any point either side can request or signal that the proxied socket is closed by sending a `sock` with a value of "closed".

### `req` - HTTP Proxy

Any HTTP request can be performed within a stream using the `req` and `res` objects.  A `stream` is required and must be unique to each request.  

The `req` is an object that looks like:

    "req": {
	    "m":"GET",
	    "p":"/foo?id=42",
	    "h":{ "User-Agent": "testing" }
	}

It can also be a POST, PUT, etc, and any content body on the request should be included as binary in the BODY on the packet and spread across subsequent packets containing only just the same `stream` value if it's larger than a single one.  When all the BODY data has been sent, a `done` of true must be set on the last packet (or first one if it was all self contained).

Any response works identically, a `res` object like:

    "res": {
        "s":200,
        "h":{ "Content-Type": "foo", "Content-Length":100 }
    }

The binary body is appended to the packet, and when broken across multiple they must all contain just the same `stream` and the body is appended in order based on the `seq` until the last one containing the `done` of true.

### App-Specific Usage

Apps are encouraged experiment/adapt and use their own custom JSON and BODY values outside of this definition but should be cautious to name things uniquely.  All switches should process all of the defined values and if any packet has additional data that it hasn't processed it should give any app the opportunity to handle that data with whatever context the switch has about the packet/sender already (was it signed, in a line, stream, etc) to make it easy to grow and customize the protocol.
