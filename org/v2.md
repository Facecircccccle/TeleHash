telehash v2 (draft)
===================

# Introduction

(note: this is the second major version of the telehash protocol, the first one is deprecated and was a minimal experimental spec to create a distributed hash table)

Telehash is a protocol enabling applications to find, identify, and communicate directly with each other.  It is built on public-key security (PKI) and includes the ability to create peer-to-peer (P2P) connections as well as form a distributed hash-table (DHT) for decentralized architectures.  As a protocol it doesn't provide direct end-user functionality but is primarily a tool for developers to use in creating modern apps that require rich experiences and interconnectivity at scale.

The principle idea that drove the creation and development of telehash is the belief that any app should be able to easily and freely talk to any other app, enabling the same freedom for the people using them.  The challenges and complexity in doing this now with other technologies such as APIs, OAuth, and REST is only increasing, often forcing centralized and closed/gated communication platforms.  By adopting telehash in any app it immediately has a rich open foundation for not only its own needs, but also the ability to integrate and share functionality with other apps easily.

The foundation of the protocol builds on JSON as the core extensible data format with a requirement to keep it simple and lightweight enough to support apps running on networked devices and sensors. The design goals include not forcing any particular architecture design such as client-server, centralized/federated/distributed, polling/push, REST, streaming, publish-subscribe, or message passing, any can be used as telehash simply facilitates creating the bi-directional connectivity between any two or more apps.

There's some high level concepts that are important to understand when talking about anything using telehash, and the first one is that of a "network", the term describing how all telehash apps are organized.  A network is identified by a hostname (such as "telehash.org") and it represents one way for apps and services to find and talk to each other.  Each network can be open or closed in allowing apps to connect to it, closed networks are managed by "operators" who facilitate access to the resources in their network and who can connect.

Every app has a unique public id on each network it's connected to that is called it's "hashname" and is the primary means of finding and communicating with other apps in the network. Any app may have one or more networks that it's connected to, including private ones for instances or users of the same app and public ones that are providing some service to the app.

# Getting Started

In order to use telehash in an app it will need to include a switch (below), generate an RSA key-pair (every unique instance of an app has it's own), and connect to a network.  Once it's connected it can find and access other hashnames on that network as well as provide services to back out to anyone.  Typically a network has operators that manage it's own names/ids and what services are available unique to what apps are connected to it, most apps have their own network for access to their back-end, user management, profiles, notifications, etc facilities.

Most apps will use their own network to provide custom services and manage access to it. To create a new network you simply need to add a DNS SRV record to the hostname for your network that identifies one or more hashnames of operators that manage it.  (todo show example operators, software and patterns)

## Telehash Switches

The software implementations of the telehash protocol are called a "switch" and it's highly suggested to use an existing switch library or service for your platform or language versus trying to create one from scratch in order to ensure that the security and identity aspects are verified properly. If there isn't one yet then we'd love your help, pull requests to list them here are welcome!

# Protocol Details

## Vocab

* DHT - Distributed Hash Table
* NAT - A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs (Network Address Translation)
* Hashname - The SHA1(public key + network) of an RSA keypair that is part of a network, the unique ID of an individual application/instance using telehash
* Packet - A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any hashnames
* Switch - The name of the software layer or service parsing packets for one or more hashnames
* Network - A regular hostname representing a collection of hashnames that have some trust or shared resources
* Operator - A special hashname that acts as a coordinator to introduce/describe a network to any other hashname
* Line - When any two hashnames connect and exchange their identity to form a temporary session

## Parsing

Every packet must begin with two bytes that are a short unsigned integer representing the length of bytes that follow it.  That length of bytes are UTF8 encoded JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser.  The JSON is required so the length must be greater than two (the minimum JSON "{}" string) and less than the length of the raw UDP message minus two (the bytes for the short unsigned integer). Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and referenced as the 'BODY' when used.

    <length><JSON>[BODY]

Example decoding logic in node (simplified):
``` js
dgram.createSocket("udp4", function(msg){
	var length = msg.readUInt16BE(0);
    var js = JSON.parse(msg.toString("utf8", 2, length + 2));
	var body = msg.slice(length + 2);
});
```

## JSON

The JSON included in any packet is where the keys are to tell a switch how to process it based on the behaviors defined below.  It is intended to be open for growing and evolving outside of the keys defined here, but any experimental or app-specific usage must always name their fields prefixed with an _ so as to not cause conflicts, analogous to the HTTP "X-Header" pattern.

The fields used/expected will often change depending on pre-existing context (is the packet signed, is the sender trusted, etc) or based on other fields being present (is a line or a stream included).

## BODY

The optional BODY is always a raw binary of the remainder bytes between the packet's total length and that of the JSON as indicated by LENGTH above. Often a BODY is another full raw packet and will be decoded identically to being read from the network, this pattern of one packet enclosing/attaching another is how the RSA signatures and encryption are implemented.

The BODY is also used as the raw content transport for streams and for any app-specific usage.

## Packet Processing

There are two phases of processing a packet, the first one is handling ones directly from the network and verifying the validity of the sender or the request.  The second phase is processing the contents of a packet (the JSON or often the decoded packet in the BODY).

For the first validation phase these are the required fields that a switch will look for in the JSON:

* `sig` - the signature of the packet's BODY
* `line` - a negotiated secret between two hashnames
* `ref` - the hashname of another switch that was the referrer

The second phase involves processing individual fields on any validated packet (may be multiple in one packet):

* `who` - request to get the key for a hashname, `key` is the response
* `open` - request to establish a line, create a session between two hashnames, `line` is the response
* `seek` - looking for hashnames closer to this value, `see` is the response
* `pop` - used to work around NATs, also `popping` and `popped` as a result

If any of these fields are not included in an existing line, they must all be accompanied by the following to provide context:

* `to` - the hashname of the recipient
* `from` - the sending hashname
* `x` - an integer timestamp (in epoch milliseconds) of the expiration time of this packet

### Networks

A network is simply a collection of RSA public keys that have some trust each other (typically a single application domain) and is identified simply by a valid hostname.  Every public key within a network is identified by it's hashname, which is the SHA1 of it's public key + network name (simple string append of SHA1(pubkey+network)).

Every network is administrated by "operators" who will resolve a hashname to it's public key for anyone, and this list of operators is typically bundled within an app (seed list) or resolved via DNS SRV records.  To resolve a list of operators the names returned from a SRV query on _telehash._udp.network.tld must be in the format hashname.host.tld and each individually resolve to their own IP address, so that the switch has the three required parts to connect to an operator, it's hashname, IP, and port.

Operators may perform other app administrative duties such as updating the seed list, redirecting to other networks and operators, providing what level of supported protocols different hashnames have, etc.

A network may also be "open", where anyone can join and be an operator. In any open network trust must then be externally determined by the apps using it as there is no authority.

### `sig` - Signed Packets

Any packet sent between two hashnames can be signed, this is very important for the initial packets so that they can include some assertion of their validity.

To sign any packet, take it's binary serialized output (as if it was going to be written to the network) and perform an RSA HMAC-MD5 signature on it.  Use that original packet as the BODY for a new packet, and include the base64 of the signature as the value to the `sig` in the JSON.

The recipient may or may not know the public key for the sending hashname yet to validate the incoming signature and it may have to ask an operator for the key first before it can process the BODY as a new (verified) packet.

### `who` - Key Lookups

A `who` is a request to return the public key for the hashname included in it's value.

Every hashname must be able to respond to a `who` request for at least itself and optionally for any others it knows, but operators are expected to return them for any valid hashname in their network.

After verifying the request, the recipient returns the public key by sending back to the requesting hashname a packet with a `key` and the value being the same as the original `who` requested.  The BODY then contains the actual public key value, and if it's too large for one packet it can be broken into multiple, each of which contains a `seq` key with an integer value starting at 0 and incrementing.  These responses may also optionally be signed so that the recipient can validate that it came from the operator it requested it from (depending on the apps security requirements).

### `open` - Establishing a Line

The `open` key is used to establish an active session with a shared secret between any two hashnames and their current IPPs, this is called a line.  The value is a base64-encoded encrypted string, created by the sender using the recipients RSA public key to encrypt a random SHA1 value (the secret) with PKCS1 padding.  The whole packet must also be signed by the sender and verified before being processed by the recipient.

Upon receiving, any hashname can check the incoming `from` and see if it already knows the public key for it, if it does it can verify the signature, decode the `open` value using their own private key, and return a corresponding packet containing it's own encrypted secret `open` to confirm the line.  Once either side has both sent an open and received one, it creates a shared secret `line` value by combining the two secrets concatenated in sorted order, SHA1([sender.openSecret, recipient.openSecret].sort().join("")).

Once a line is calculated all subsequent packets should include only the same `line` value in each direction as the secret for the receiving switch to identify it.  Only the `open` value is used to initiate a new line at any time.

Once a line is established, any packet may be optionally encrypted since both sides have a shared secret for the other.  An encrypted packet simply includes the field `cipher` with the value true along with the `line` to signal that the BODY is the fully encrypted original packet.  The receiver then decrypts the BODY and processes it as a normal packet (LENGTH/JSON/BODY) from the sending hashname as if it had the `line` value in it.  All encryption/decryption uses "AES-128-CBC" and the secret of the recipient, with the BODY being the binary encoded result.

### `seek` - Finding Hashnames (DHT)

Any network can support a DHT if enough of it's hashnames are connected to each other and respond to `seek` requests properly.  The bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance (to be defined again here based on v1).

The `seek` value is always a 40 character hex (a SHA1 of anything), it can be used to find other hashnames directly or by an app to find one or more hashnames for any arbitrary content.  Each network and app may use this differently, but the basic rules around discovery are the same.

When one hashname wants to lookup a hash, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `see` array of addresses that are closer to the hash value than they are, if any (no response if none).  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d,123.45.67.89,10111" and the IP can be v4 or v6 (there can be multiple entries in the array for one hashname).

Any `seek` that is not part of a line may be signed if it's known the recipient has their public key to verify (like to an operator), but most of these requests in a normal DHT lookup will be to hashnames that will likely never need to be interacted with again so a lightweight verification called `ref` is used to assert a minimum level of trust.  These non-line and non-signed seek requests must include a `ref` with the value being the hashname that the recipient was discovered from (in a `see` response);  All hashnames must then open one or more lines in order to begin doing `seek` requests starting from them.  Any incoming `ref` must be validated by the recipient such that they have an open line to the hashname in the value so that they know who referred them.

### `pop` - Working around NATs 

When any hashname is told about a new one (in the `see`), there may be a NAT between them so they must both be told to send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." The `pop` value is used to do this and contains the target hashname being contacted for the first time.  Any `pop` works just like a `seek` and must be in a line, signed, or contain a `ref` for validation.

The recipient of the `pop` must then send a `poping` with the value being the address (hash,ip,port) of the `pop` sender, and send this to the hashname identified in the value of the `pop` that is has a line open to.

The `popping` recipient then sends an ad-hock packet with a `popped` of true to the address given in the `popping` value (along with a `ref` value of the hashname the `popping` came from to validate) if it hasn't seen any packets from that hashname yet (it's own NAT may have dropped them).  This should then create the proper routes between any two NATs for the two to talk.

When the original hashname receives a `popped` it should validate it and then resend the original packet it was trying to send to the target hashname since the path should be open now and the original was likely dropped.

### `stream` - Ordering and Retransmission

A line establishes a lossy connection between hashnames, streamer adds a lightweight stream representation to order, buffer, and retransmit packets.

Any hashname can open a stream simply by sending a `stream` key with a unique 40 length hex value (SHA1) that is the same on all subsequent packets for that stream and returned in all responses by the receiver. All streams have a `seq` integer value that starts at 0 and increments per packet sent.

A buffer of sent packets must be kept keyed by the `seq` value until the receiving hashname has responded confirming them in a `ack` and not in the `miss`. The `ack` is the highest known `seq` value received. The `miss` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `ack` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the missing sequence values up to the `ack`.  Upon receipt those missed packets should be resent verbatim.

By default a session should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default (senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When there's consistently missing packets, senders should limit the number of packets beyond the confirmed range. (TBD)

The JSON and/or BODY can be used arbitrarily within a stream by an app, multiple streams may exist between two hashnames and their state should be preserved as long as the line is open.

### `sock` - Socket Proxy

A stream can be requested to become a simple raw TCP socket proxy by sending a `sock` key with a value of any "IP:PORT", the receiving hashname should carefully decide if it wants to support this and the destination IP to prevent accidental abuse.  If the socket couldn't open or is closed at any point by either side an `end` of true is sent and any informative `err` string value can be included.

As soon as a `sock` is sent it is considered open by the sender until it receives an `end` telling it otherwise, the stream will inherently only send so much data without any confirmation from the recipient that it's open/reading.

### `req` - HTTP Proxy

Any HTTP request can be performed within a stream using the `req` and `res` objects.  A `stream` is required and must be unique to each request.  

The `req` is an object that looks like:

    "req": {
	    "m":"GET",
	    "p":"/foo?id=42",
	    "h":{ "User-Agent": "testing" }
	}

It can also be a POST, PUT, etc, and any content body on the request should be included as binary in the BODY on the packet and spread across subsequent packets containing only just the same `stream` value if it's larger than a single one.  When all the BODY data has been sent, an `end` of true must be set on the last packet (or first one if it was all self contained).

Any response works identically, a `res` object like:

    "res": {
        "s":200,
        "h":{ "Content-Type": "foo", "Content-Length":100 }
    }

The binary body is appended to the packet, and when broken across multiple they must all contain just the same `stream` and the body is appended in order based on the `seq` until the last one containing the `end` of true.

### App-Specific Usage

Apps are encouraged experiment/adapt and use their own custom JSON and BODY values outside of this definition but must prefix all custom JSON fields with an underscore ({"_foo":"bar"}) so as to not cause future conflicts.  All switches should process all of the defined values and if any packet has additional data that it hasn't processed it should give any app the opportunity to handle that data with whatever context the switch has about the packet/sender already (was it signed, in a line, stream, etc) to make it easy to grow and customize the protocol.
