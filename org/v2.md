telehash v2 (draft)
===================

## Intro

The first version was a minimal layer to do just the DHT/NAT and tried to be very generic and extensible, deferring identity and transport to the app.  This second version drastically simplifies the base protocol and incorporates the identity and transport elements into the core.

## Vocab

* DHT - Distributed Hash Table
* NAT - A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs (Network Address Translation)
* IPP - IP:Port, 123.45.67.89:10111
* Hashname - The sha1(public key) of a RSA keypair
* Profile - The JSON containing at least `key` being the public key, and other app-specific fields
* Switch - The software hosting one more more hashname on active IPP, making them part of the DHT
* Packet - A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any hashnames
* Session - When two hashnames verify each other and maintain a reliable connection between them
* Thread - Simple request and response tracking id within a session
* Voucher - A JSON object containing `by` being the hashname doing the vouching, `x` an integer of the expiration time of the voucher (in epoch milliseconds), and `v` the signature of a Profile and the included expiration time.

## Parsing

Every packet must begin with two bytes that are a short unsigned integer representing the length of bytes that follow it.  That length of bytes are UTF8 encoded JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser.  Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and referenced as the 'body' during content transport.

## JSON

The top level keys of the JSON are for switch use only, the presence of different keys trigger different responses:

### "to", "from" (IDENTITY)

Any packet sent outside of a session must have a `to` and a `from` of the recipient and requesting hashnames.

### "tid" (THREADS)

The value is any string, and is the thread id as defined by the sending switch.  When received and any response is generated at all, the same tid value must be returned so the sending switch can match up the response to it's request.  The value format can be anything and is the domain of the sending switch only.

### "sig", "x", and "sid" (SESSION SETUP)

This is to initiate a new session with any hashname, the included body must be a voucher.  The value of `sig` is the signature of the voucher and the included `x`, the expiration timestamp.

Upon receiving a `sig` one should be returned to create a full session.  Any packets sent after the first one should include a `sid` being the sha1 of the initial sig and considered part of the session.

### "seq", "range", and "miss" (SESSION RELIABILITY)

These are only allowed along with a `sid` and are the mechanism for reliable packet delivery.  The `seq` must always be increased incrementally with every packet sent.  A buffer of sent packets must be kept keyed by the `seq` value until the receiving switch has responded confirming them in a `range` and not in the `miss`.

The `range` is an array of two integers, the first seq received in the session, and the last one received.

The `miss` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `range` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the missing sequence values within the associated `range`.  Upon receipt those packets should be resent verbatim.

By default a session should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default (senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When there's consistently missing packets, senders should not send very many packets beyond the confirmed range. (TBD)

### "pop" (NATs)

When any switch is told about another, there may be a NAT between them, so they must both be told to send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." The `pop` value is used to do this, containing the IPP of the switch being contacted for the first time.

The local switch is A, the existing one in the DHT is B, and this happens when B tells A about C, a new switch that A may be interested in.  When A goes to contact C it should send the packet directly, as well as send a packet containing a `pop`:"IPP of C" to B.  Upon receiving a `pop` with an IPP value that is not itself, it sends a new packet with a `pop` and the same value to the given IPP, as well as setting the `source` value to that of A. When C receives a `pop` value of itself, it sends a packet with `popped`:true to the value of `source`.  If the first packet A receives from C is `popped`:true, it should resend the original packet since it was likely dropped due to the NAT, but the path is open now.

### "req" and "res" (CONTENT TRANSPORT)

Any HTTP request can be performed within a session using the `req` and `res` objects.  A `tid` is required and must be unique to each request.  

The `req` is an object that looks like:

    "req": {
	    "uri":"http://telehash.org/"
	    "m":"GET",
	    "h":{ "User-Agent": "testing" }
	}

It can also be a POST or PUT, and any content body on the request should be included as binary appended to the packet, and spread across subsequent packets containing only just the same `tid` value if it's larger than a single one.  When all the data has been sent, a `done` of true must be set on the last packet (or first one if it was all self contained).

Any response works identically, a `res` object like:

    "res": {
        "s":200,
        "h":{ "Content-Type": "foo", "Content-Length":100 }
    }

The binary body is appended to the packet, and when broken across multiple they must all contain just the same `tid` and the body is appended in order based on the `seq` until the last one containing the `done` of true.

The URI in the request doesn't need to be just HTTP either, this pattern can be used for streaming or other content transport patterns, and application specific schemes.

### "seek" and "see" (CONNECTING)

To reach any other switch you have to use the DHT to find it or the switches close to the same hash you're both using.  You start by contacting any switch closest to the target hashname and a `seek` with the hash value (and `tid` as needed).  If that switch knows any closer, it will respond with a `see` array of other switches closer than it.  Take the top three closest and repeat the process until nobody responds or you contact the target hashname.

## DHT

This is almost the same as telehash v1 and needs to be re-described here yet...

## Hashname state

At any point the relationship between two hashnames would be in one of the following states:

* UNKNOWN - no contact
* SEEKING - one hashname is looking for another on the DHT
* CONNECTING - was given an IPP for a hashname and sent it a sig
* CONNECTED - both sent and received a sig
* VALIDATING - requesting the profile of a hashname to get the public key to verify the sig value
* VALIDATED - the sig and voucher check out
* TRUSTED - the hashname or voucher are known and trusted
